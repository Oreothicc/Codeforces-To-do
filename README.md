# Codeforces-To-do
Creates a to do list of codeforces problems from a question bank 

So it all started over a week long break- I had a bunch of codeforces questions I wanted to solve but without a search feature on codeforces it was hard to track down which ones I had already submitted (especially because I'd solved some of these YEARS ago)

So I made a quick python tool to help me out, a very niche solution to a very niche problem. But problem solving for the win!
